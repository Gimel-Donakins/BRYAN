at the crack of dawn, eyelids open, but bryan is breathing over your bed
and at 9:30 each night Bryan BANGS down room 325's door because Eli once again forgot to check into the building
Sean left his milk on the counter, Eli was laying in bed, and Lucas was doing Lucas things

[Chorus]
The Bacon is fryin' thanks to Bryan
The weights are flyin', you're the best Bryan
Chuck Norris is sighing, pretty cool Bryan
One day I was cryin' but no more because Bryan
For the room check we were tryin' but we won thanks to cuz of bryan 
At Nathan's house through the curtains Bryan be spyin'

one day I was walking on the sidewalk when I saw Jesse being carried by the likes of Bryan
and I was scared for a second because I was in awe of the awful strength of the chef mentor man Bryan
and I calmed down and started my load of drying and had a nice chat with Daniel the other cool guy before taking an investment
... the investment paid off
